The only code that you should have to change is the last line in which you may set jupiter to be True or False. False sends
a satellite to Mars and True sends a satellite to Jupiter. If you wish the patches to be larger or smaller you may alter their
sizes in line 433 by chaning the values in the list. Other than that the code works as expected.
